Learn something about Virat Kohli here: 
  Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 
Raina was named captain and Kohli vice-captain for the tri-series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe
and so on..
or the first Test of the Australian tour in December 2014,
 Dhoni was not part of the Indian team at Adelaide due to an injury, and Kohli took
 the reins as Test captain for the first time.[197] Kohli scored 115 in India's first innings,
 
becoming the fourth Indian to score a hundred on Test captaincy debut.[198] In their second innings,
 India were set a target of 364 to be scored on the fifth day. Kohli came in to bat when the Indian innings 
was reduced to 57/2 and started batting aggressively. He put on 185 runs for the third wicket with Murali Vijay before Vijay's dismissal,
 which triggered a batting collapse. From 242/2, India was bowled out for 315 with Kohli's 141 off 175 balls being the top score 
Kohli noted that his team was looking for a win and not a draw, while also saying that it was "the best Test I have been part of".
 Kohli's second innings ton was hailed by several Australian commentators 
as the finest fourth-innings performance they had ever seen in Australia.
